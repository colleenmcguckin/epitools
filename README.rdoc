= epitools

Useful miscellaneous improvements for base Ruby objects, plus some extra
data structures and handy wrappers.

Base classess have been enhanced: {Enumerable}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Enumerable], {Hash}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Hash], {String}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/String], {Array}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Array], {Object}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Object], {Integer}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Integer], etc.

Extras:

* {Colored}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Colored] (enhanced version of defunkt's colored -- adds ANSI colouring methods to String, eg: #red, #green, #light_blue, etc.)
* {Path}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Path] (a better Pathname)
* {Rash}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Rash] (a hash which can have Regexps as keys, allowing a single (key,value) pair to match many keys.)
* {Progressbar}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Progressbar] (better than the progressbar gem)
* {Browser}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Browser] (a fake browser, using mechanize, Progressbar, and CacheDB)
