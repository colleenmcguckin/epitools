= epitools

Useful miscellaneous improvements for base Ruby objects, plus some extra
data structures and handy wrappers. You can think of it as a light-weight
ActiveSupport.

All epitools modules (and a bunch of Ruby's stdlib) are 
{loaded on demand with "autoload"}[https://github.com/epitron/epitools/blob/master/lib/epitools/autoloads.rb],
so it's really fast. (Require this in your .irbrc or .pryrc, and you'll never have to require another Ruby stdlib module again!)

Enhanced base classes: {Enumerable}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Enumerable], {Hash}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Hash], {String}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/String], {Array}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Array], {File}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/File], {Object}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Object], {Integer}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Integer], etc.

Extras:

* {Path}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Path] (an object-oriented interface to the filessytem -- like File, Dir, Pathname, and FileUtils all rolled into one)
* {TypedStruct}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/TypedStruct] (like Struct, but setters always coerce input to a certain type, eg: boolean, integer, etc.)
* {WM}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/WM] (control/query desktop windows in X. Note: `wmctrl` must be installed)
* {Sys}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Sys] (system tools -- determine operating system, list processes, view network statistics, etc.)
* {Colored}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Colored] (enhanced version of defunkt's colored -- adds ANSI colouring methods to String, eg: #red, #green, #light_blue, etc.)
* {Term}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Term] (a toolbox for making terminal-based scripts -- get terminal size, create tables, etc.)
* {Iter}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Iter] (a "stable iterator" -- lets you write algorithms that modify the array as you're iterating; good for clustering.)
* {Browser}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Browser] (a fake browser, with a cache, cookies, download progress bars, plus the rest of the mechanize/nokogiri API you know and love)
* {Rash}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Rash] (a hash which can have Regexps as keys, so that many input keys can map to a single value.)
* {Progressbar}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/Progressbar] (better than the progressbar gem)
* {MimeMagic}[http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/MimeMagic] (a port of the Unix `file` utility for automatically recognizing files based on their contents; faster than running `file` on every file if you have to process large batches of files. This is originally from the mimemagic gem by {Daniel Mendler}[https://github.com/minad], and has been slightly modified and enhanced.)

== Installing

  gem install epitools

== Usage

This is basically a collection of enhancements to the ruby base types (Hash, Array,
Enumerable, etc.). To learn how it works, read the specs in spec/*.rb,
or check out the rdoc: http://rdoc.info/github/epitron/epitools/master/frames
